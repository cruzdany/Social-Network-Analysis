The definition of this distance-based measure assume that the shortest-path length is defined for each pair of nodes. If there is any pairs without a path, then the the average path length is not defined. One way to present this result is by measuring only on the giant component; for the directed network it is possible to consider directed paths in the giants strongly connected component. However, due to the number of possible pairs of nodes, the computing of the average shortest-path length can be computational extensive.\n",
